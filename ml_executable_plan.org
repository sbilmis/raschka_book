* How to use this file
- Each week has actionable TODOs for:
  - Study (2h/day), Raw notes in Org (:lecture: :SME: :demo: tags)
  - Code snippets / notebooks
  - Teaching deliverables (Reveal.js deck, Jupyter demo)
  - MkDocs publishing checkpoint
- Mark tasks DONE as you proceed. Filter by tags to extract teaching material:
  - =C-c \= then type ~lecture~ or ~SME~ or ~demo~
