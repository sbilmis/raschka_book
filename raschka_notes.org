* Intro 

- In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton et al. published a paper showing how to train a  deep neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits with state-ofthe-art precision (>98%). (Hinton, Geoffrey E., Simon Osindero, and Yee-Whye Teh. “A Fast Learning Algorithm for Deep Belief Nets.” Neural Computation 18, no. 7 (July 2006): 1527–54. https://doi.org/10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527 .)  See here
  
- They named this technique as "deep learning"
- Training a deep neural net  was widely considered impossible at the time, and most researchers had  abandoned the idea in the late 1990s. This paper revived the interest of the  scientific community, and before long many new papers demonstrated that  deep learning was not only possible, but capable of mind-blowing  achievements that no other machine learning (ML) technique could hope to  match (with the help of tremendous computing power and great amounts of  data). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of machine learning.

* Chapter 1: Giving computers the Ability to Learn from the Data

- Machine learning is ability to learn from data
- Three different types of machine learning:
  - Supervised Learning
    - Labeled Data
    - Direct Feedback
    - Predict outcome/future
  - Unsupervised Learnning
    - No labels/targets
    - No feedback
    - Find hidden structure in data
  - Reinforcement Learning
    - Decision process
    - Reward system
    - Learn series of actions

** Supervised Learning:
- The main goal in supervised learning is to learn a model from labeled training data that allows us to   make predictions about unseen or future data.
- “supervised” refers to a set of training   examples(data inputs) where the desired output signals (labels) are already known
