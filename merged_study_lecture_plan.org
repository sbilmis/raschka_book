** Slide Tooling Notes
- Prefer Org + reveal.js for theory slides; export to HTML/PDF.
- Keep **live demos** in Jupyter notebooks (RISE for slideshow) or JupyterLite (offline).
- For SME workshops without stable internet, rely on PDFs and pre-rendered outputs.
- Use Keynote only for final polish/animations when needed.
